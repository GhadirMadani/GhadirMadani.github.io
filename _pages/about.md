Welcome to my Digital Humanities portfolio for Spring 2025. This website brings together the projects and reflections I completed for my *Introduction to Digital Humanities* course. Throughout the semester, we explored how digital tools and computational methods can be used to ask new questions, tell stories, and analyze culture in ways that go beyond traditional approaches.

Digital Humanities isn’t just about using technology; it’s about thinking critically with it. In this course, I experimented with visualizations, data mining, text analysis, and AI tools to better understand how meaning is made, how information is structured, and how cultural narratives are shaped in the digital age.

## What You'll Find Here

### Assignment 1: How Feminist Ideas Evolved
In this project, I explored how feminist thought has changed over time by analyzing three major texts: *A Vindication of the Rights of Woman* by Mary Wollstonecraft, *The Second Sex* by Simone de Beauvoir, and *Ain’t I a Woman* by Bell Hooks. Using Voyant Tools and R Markdown, I applied distant reading techniques to examine patterns in language, word frequency, and thematic focus. The analysis revealed how feminist discourse evolved from calls for education and moral reform to critiques of existential identity and intersectional oppression. This assignment taught me how digital tools can uncover both patterns and blind spots in textual analysis, and how important it is to interpret those patterns critically.

### **Assignment 2: Thick Mapping Zanzibar**
Building on the first assignment, I created a more interpretive and layered “thick map” of colonial shipping data. This time, I explored not just where ships traveled, but what those routes implied about colonial power, trade, and circulation. I used mapping tools alongside critical readings to explore how visualizations can both reveal and obscure meaning. This project taught me that digital tools can help tell stories, but they also require careful, ethical framing.

### **Assignment 3: Visual AI and Culture**
For this assignment, I built a custom image corpus focused on UAE heritage and used tools like Orange Data Mining and DV Explorer to analyze how machine learning models “see” culture. I tested clustering, classification, and image captioning, and reflected on how AI systems often misinterpret or flatten cultural meaning. This project pushed me to think critically about algorithmic bias, representation, and what it means when machines try to read images.

### **Digital Literacy Narrative**
Throughout the semester, I also developed a personal digital literacy narrative; a reflection on how my relationship with technology has evolved. I wrote about my journey from being a consumer of digital tools to becoming someone who creates, questions, and critiques them. I explored moments of growth, confusion, and discovery, and connected them to course readings like *Distant Viewing*, the Making and Knowing Project, and our discussions on AI, maps, and data.

## Final Reflection

This course taught me that being digitally literate isn’t just about knowing how to use software; it’s about understanding systems, questioning assumptions, and thinking across disciplines. Whether I was mapping colonial histories or analyzing AI-generated image captions, I learned to ask: *Who built this tool? What does it assume? Whose perspective does it center, or ignore?*

Digital Humanities helped me see that data is never neutral, and that digital methods can open up powerful new ways of engaging with the past, present, and future.

Thanks for exploring my work.
