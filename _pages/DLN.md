## Digital Literacy Narrative 1

### Reflections on Digital Literacy: A University Student’s Perspective
As a 19-year-old university student at a liberal arts institution, I’ve experienced digital literacy through different academic lenses. I initially started as a Biology major, where my engagement with digital tools revolved around data analysis, research databases, and lab simulations. Now, as an Interactive Media (IM) major, my relationship with technology has shifted toward creative coding, user interface design, and digital storytelling. This transition has made me realize that digital literacy isn’t just about technical proficiency, it’s about adapting, questioning, and effectively using digital tools across disciplines.
### Digital Literacy in Content Creation and Social Interaction
Digital literacy shapes how I engage with both creative work and social interactions. While my focus has shifted from scientific research to interactive design, I still rely on digital platforms to create and share content. In Interactive Media, we use Adobe XD for wireframing and Visual Studio Code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) for programming websites. We also work with Unity for interactive experiences, as well as Adobe Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve when video editing is needed for certain projects. My peers in Film and New Media use these tools more extensively for video production and editing, while Literature students use platforms like Medium and Substack for publishing. No matter the discipline, we all rely on digital tools to distribute our work, communicate with audiences, and collaborate.
Social interaction is also shaped by digital fluency. Platforms like Discord, Slack, and Trello help facilitate both academic projects and extracurricular activities. I use Instagram and TikTok to engage with creative communities, while my Art History peers curate digital exhibitions using Google Arts & Culture. Understanding how these platforms influence engagement is a crucial skill, one that extends beyond social interactions to how we construct and critique digital narratives.
### Digital Research and Data Management
Research and data management remain central to my academic experience, though my approach has evolved. As a former Biology major, I worked with scientific tools like MATLAB for data analysis, ChemDraw for drawing molecular structures, and SnapGene for visualizing DNA sequences. Now, in Interactive Media, I use Visual Studio Code for web development, Unity for creating interactive experiences, and GitHub for version control in programming projects. My Art and Art History peers rely on JSTOR and Artstor, while my Computer Science friends work with Unity and Unreal Engine for interactive and game design projects. No matter the discipline, organizing and analyzing digital information is crucial for efficient research and critical engagement with sources.
Data manipulation also plays a role in my new field. I once used MATLAB for biological data analysis, but now I focus more on working with Unity for interactive media development and Processing for creative coding. My Computer Science peers use Python for data science applications, while those in Film and New Media analyze audience engagement metrics with Google Analytics. Each field has its own toolkit, but digital humanities bridge these disciplines, showing how computational approaches can enhance our understanding of literature, design, and media.
### Digital Humanities and New Horizons in Learning
The field of digital humanities provides an interdisciplinary space where traditional humanistic inquiry meets computational methods. Before taking courses in digital humanities, I viewed textual analysis as a primarily close-reading endeavor. However, through exposure to machine learning models for sentiment analysis and topic modeling, I have begun to see literature not just as a collection of individual texts but as part of larger, analyzable systems. Digital humanities expand what is possible in my field, from network analysis of characters in novels to computational studies of authorship attribution.
This exposure has also deepened my understanding of computational thinking, as described by Berry and Fagerjord—not just as programming but as a cognitive practice that involves practical wisdom and reflection on computation itself. In collaborative settings, my peers and I negotiate different approaches to problems: a computer science student might suggest algorithmic sorting for a dataset, while a literature student like myself might emphasize the ethical implications of data collection. These interdisciplinary discussions challenge us to develop nuanced perspectives on digital methods, recognizing both their potential and their limitations.
### Critical Reflections on My Digital Abilities and Future Growth
Despite my growing proficiency in digital research tools, I recognize gaps in my understanding. While I am comfortable with basic text mining and visualization techniques, I would like to develop deeper expertise in natural language processing and data storytelling. AI presents new frontiers in creative writing, from generative text models to interactive storytelling experiences, and I am curious about how these tools can be critically and creatively engaged.
Additionally, I want to explore the ethical dimensions of digital work. How do biases in AI systems shape the way information is processed and disseminated? How can we ensure that digital tools do not reinforce systemic inequalities in academia and beyond? Digital literacy is not just about technical proficiency but about developing a critical lens through which to evaluate digital systems and their impact on society.
### Conclusion
As I continue my university journey, I’m excited to deepen my engagement with digital humanities and computational thinking. Digital literacy isn’t a fixed skill, it evolves as new technologies emerge and as our needs change. By collaborating across disciplines, questioning digital tools, and exploring new ways of interacting with data, I hope to develop a fluency that is both technically proficient and critically aware. The liberal arts, with their emphasis on interdisciplinary learning, provide the perfect space for this exploration, where technology and the humanities don’t just coexist, but actively inform and enrich one another.

## Digital Literacy Narrative 2

### Reflections on Digital Literacy: A University Student’s Perspective
As a 19-year-old university student at NYUAD, I’ve experienced digital literacy through different academic lenses. I initially started as a Biology major, where my engagement with digital tools revolved around data analysis, research databases, and lab simulations. Now, as an Interactive Media (IM) major, my relationship with technology has shifted toward creative coding, user interface design, digital storytelling, 3D modeling and more. This shift has taught me that digital literacy isn’t just about knowing how to use a software; it’s about learning to think critically with technology, ask questions, and use digital tools in meaningful ways. 
### Digital Literacy in Content Creation and Social Interaction
Digital literacy shapes how I engage with both creative work and social interactions. While my focus has shifted from scientific research to interactive design, I still rely on digital platforms to create and share content. In Interactive Media, we use different software for different purposes, some for 3D modeling others for coding and much more. 
These softwares are now part of my everyday academic life, and they help me think through creative problems. As Berry (2019) explains in “What Are the Digital Humanities?”, knowing how to use technology isn’t just a skill; it’s a way of learning and exploring. My peers in Film and New Media use tools for video production and editing more extensively , while Literature students use platforms like Medium and Substack for publishing. No matter the discipline, we all rely on digital tools to distribute our work, communicate with audiences, and collaborate.
Social interaction is also shaped by digital fluency. Platforms like Discord and Slack help facilitate both academic projects and extracurricular activities. Being fluent on how different platforms and softwares work, and how people interact with them is just as important as technical skills. 
### Digital Research and Data Management
Research and data management remain central to my academic experience, though my approach has evolved. As a former Biology major, I worked with data analysis, drawing molecular structures, and visualizing DNA sequences. Now, in Interactive Media, I work with web development, creating interactive experiences,and programming websites. 
I've also learned that data is never just “neutral”; it’s shaped by how we collect and use it. In Chapter 3 of her book, Johanna Drucker reminds us that data is always “capta”; something captured, not just given. This idea changed how I look at research. No matter the discipline, organizing and analyzing digital information is crucial for efficient research and critical engagement with sources.
Data manipulation also plays a role in my new field. I once workes with biological data analysis, but now I focus more on working interactive media development and processing for creative coding. While my Computer Science peers use data science applications, and those in Film and New Media analyze audience engagement metrics. Each field has its own toolkit, but digital humanities bridge these disciplines, showing how computational approaches can enhance our understanding of literature, design, and media.
Rockwell and Sinclair’s article, “The Measured Words” (2016), introduced me to how computers can help us analyze texts by looking at word patterns, topics, or tone. Before this, I thought of reading as something slow and close. Now I realize there’s value in stepping back and looking at a larger group of texts to find patterns we might miss otherwise.
### Digital Humanities and New Horizons in Learning
The field of digital humanities provides an interdisciplinary space where traditional humanistic inquiry meets computational methods. Before taking this course about digital humanities, I viewed textual analysis as a primarily close-reading endeavor. However, through exposure to machine learning models for sentiment analysis and topic modeling, I have begun to see literature not just as a collection of individual texts but as part of larger, analyzable systems. 
One podcast we listened to in class is a conversation with Ama Bemma Adwetewa-Badu, where the idea of "distant reading" was introduced. That’s when instead of reading one book closely, you look at patterns across hundreds or thousands of texts. That really opened up my understanding of what research in the humanities can look like today. Digital humanities expand what is possible in my field, from network analysis of characters in novels to computational studies of authorship attribution.
This exposure has also deepened my understanding of computational thinking, as described by Berry and Fagerjord, not just as programming but as a cognitive practice that involves practical wisdom and reflection on computation itself. In collaborative settings, my peers and I negotiate different approaches to problems: a computer science student might suggest algorithmic sorting for a dataset, while a literature student might emphasize the ethical implications of data collection. Working together across different backgrounds has helped me think more carefully about how we use technology and who it impacts.
One article that really stuck with me was “How to Get Started in Digital Humanities in 2023, and Why” by Mattingly. Mattingly talks about the value of building things; not just reading or analyzing, but actually making websites, visualizations, and tools. This approach matches how we learn in Interactive Media and has made me feel more connected to my projects.
### Critical Reflections on My Digital Abilities and Future Growth
Despite my growing proficiency in digital research tools, I recognize gaps in my understanding. While I am comfortable with basic text mining and visualization techniques, I would like to develop deeper expertise in natural language processing and data storytelling. AI presents new frontiers in creative writing, from generative text models to interactive storytelling experiences, and I am curious about how these tools can be critically and creatively engaged.
Our class reading on large language models (LLMs) and intelligence made me think more about how tools like ChatGPT actually work. I started asking questions like: What does it mean for a machine to “understand” something? How can we tell if an AI model is biased or limited? These questions have made me more careful in how I use and talk about AI in creative projects.
Additionally, I want to explore the ethical dimensions of digital work. How do biases in AI systems shape the way information is processed and disseminated? How can we ensure that digital tools do not reinforce systemic inequalities in academia and beyond? Digital literacy is not just about technical proficiency but about developing a critical lens through which to evaluate digital systems and their impact on society.
Chachra’s essay “Why I Am Not a Maker” also helped me rethink how we value digital work. It made me realize that not all important work is about building something new; sometimes organizing, maintaining, or reflecting on tools and systems is just as valuable.
### Conclusion
As I continue my university journey, I’m excited to deepen my engagement with digital humanities and computational thinking. Digital literacy isn’t a fixed skill, it evolves as new technologies emerge and as our needs change. By collaborating across disciplines, questioning digital tools, and exploring new ways of interacting with data, I hope to develop a fluency that is both technically proficient and critically aware. As Drucker writes in Chapter 8, the goal is not just to use tools, but to develop “phronesis”; a kind of practical wisdom that helps us make good choices in digital contexts. The liberal arts, with their emphasis on interdisciplinary learning, provide the perfect space for this exploration, where technology and the humanities don’t just coexist, but actively inform and enrich one another.
