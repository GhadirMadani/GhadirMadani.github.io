## Thick Mapping Zanzibar (January-March 1913): Visualizing Shipping Routes from the Zanzibar Gazette

## 1. Introduction
This project looks at maritime activity in East Africa during the British colonial period by focusing on shipping reports from the Zanzibar Gazette. The Gazette was a government-run newspaper that published all kinds of administrative records, including weekly updates on ship traffic. I chose to work with the Shipping Reports section because it lists the names of ships, where they came from, where they were going, and when they arrived or departed — which makes it ideal for mapping.

For this project, I collected and organized 127 entries, covering a three-month period from **the week ending 5 January 1913 to the week ending 30 March 1913**. Each row in my dataset represents the movement of a ship through the Port of Zanzibar (Unguja), either arriving, departing, or staying in harbour.

By focusing on this short but detailed time frame, I was able to get a clear sense of how Zanzibar was connected to other places in the Indian Ocean — like Bombay, Mombasa, Durban, Marseille, and more — and how colonial trade operated through these routes.
